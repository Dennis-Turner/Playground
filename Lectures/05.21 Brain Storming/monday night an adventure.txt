We could not get into our planned location. 

And time ticked on with our fearless leader coming with a spread sheet and a plan.
Yet, as our group brainstorming on the patio grew, we changed the venue to the campus library across the parking lot.

Packed into a study room with a tv and a personal fan.
Then we brain stormed with a positive result.
We will modify the letter gathering form to have 4 location dots.
This should make alignment and the python to extract the test letters easier.
So we can get reasonably quicker to the task of making our Neural Network.

More discussion is necessary for the actual NN goal. From being a better OCR to some other nuances in writing.
