Import cv, numpy, etc...

get and load image.jpg

find interesting real estate on the image.

	loop and look and slice and test to find the dots

	record the location of the dots
	
	test your locations to make sure you got em.
		if (got dots) then I expect to see lines here and here
			DO I have a line? 
			Do I have a second line?
 		if (got lines) then set flag true
 # alternativly
 		If I (got dots) I can transform as necessary to put the dots in a proper place
 			get the letters cause we know they are each in a box.
 			#this required a new form with more location marks - dots 
 			#see the NewForm folder in the TDS_Image_Proj folder

if (got dots and flag) then
	calculate the transform to get the lines square.
	apply the transform
	loop 24 times 
		each itteration to get one of the images
		output the images to a special folder and drink a beer. part one of n-1 parts done!!!
